# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
0.63, The R-squared value shows how well the line fits the data, telling us how much of the change in blood pressure can be explained by a person's age, a value closer to 1 means the line fits really well.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
134.4
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? No because this isn't for everyone and it's only a small sample of people being measured and we don't know other health conditions that people could have that effect it. Improving the model would require more data.
